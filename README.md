# My Roguelike Game Project

This project is a roguelike game developed in Python, based on the [Python roguelike tutorial](http://www.rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/).

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running on your computer:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/2nPlusOne/python-roguelike
   \`\`\`

2. **Install Python 3.7 or Higher**: You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Setup a Virtual Environment**:
   Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to set up and run a virtual environment.

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory and Install Dependencies**:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd <insert-directory-name-here>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

5. **Install SDL2 (sometimes required depending on the system)**: Look-up and follow the instructions based on your OS.

6. **Run the Project**:
   \`\`\`bash
